  # Ansible hooks

        additional_dependencies:
          # On its own ansible-lint does not pull in ansible, only
          # ansible-core.  Therefore, if an Ansible module lives in
          # ansible instead of ansible-core, the linter will complain
          # that the module is unknown.  In these cases it is
          # necessary to add the ansible package itself as an
          # additional dependency, with the same pinning as is done in
          # requirements-test.txt of cisagov/skeleton-ansible-role.
          #
          # Version 10 is required because the pip-audit pre-commit
          # hook identifies a vulnerability in ansible-core 2.16.13,
          # but all versions of ansible 9 have a dependency on
          # ~=2.16.X.
          #
          # It is also a good idea to go ahead and upgrade to version
          # 10 since version 9 is going EOL at the end of November:
          # https://endoflife.date/ansible
          # - ansible>=10,<11
          # ansible-core 2.16.3 through 2.16.6 suffer from the bug
          # discussed in ansible/ansible#82702, which breaks any
          # symlinked files in vars, tasks, etc. for any Ansible role
          # installed via ansible-galaxy.  Hence we never want to
          # install those versions.
          #
          # Note that the pip-audit pre-commit hook identifies a
          # vulnerability in ansible-core 2.16.13.  The pin of
          # ansible-core to >=2.17 effectively also pins ansible to
          # >=10.
          #
          # It is also a good idea to go ahead and upgrade to
          # ansible-core 2.17 since security support for ansible-core
          # 2.16 ends this month:
          # https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#ansible-core-support-matrix
          #
          # Note that any changes made to this dependency must also be
          # made in requirements.txt in cisagov/skeleton-packer and
          # requirements-test.txt in cisagov/skeleton-ansible-role.
